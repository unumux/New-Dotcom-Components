# **Feature Banner**

# **Requirements**

This module is a banner that includes the following possible elements:

- Headline [required]
- Subheadline
- Description [required]
- Button
- Image (needs to support gifs as well) [required]

# **Notes**

Images and videos in this component will be design elements only, meaning they should not contain content we expect users to pay close attention to or in the case of a video be able to control playback.  

So images and videos will be implemented using background image styling.  Developers would be advised to use a modal tied to the action button in the content section of this banner to play a video that isn't a design element.
