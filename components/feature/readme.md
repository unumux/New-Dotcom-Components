# **Notes**

Images and videos in this component will be design elements only, meaning they should not contain content we expect users to pay close attention to or in the case of a video be able to control playback.  

So images and videos will be implemented using background image styling.  Developers would be advised to use a modal tied to the action button in the content section of this banner to play a video that isn't a design element.
