# **CL Header**

**Requirements**

The header’s navigation links will reflect which section of the site the user is in. 

For the Site Section / Context Selector, all main sections of ColonialLife.com will be reflected in this selector. These sections currently include:
* Individuals and Policyholders → cookie / personalization
* Employers and Plan Administrators → cookie / personalization
* Brokers and Consultants → cookie / personalization
* Join Our Sales Team
* Contact Us
* About Us
* Careers
* Blog
* Legal
    
Sitecore will remember the user’s selection if they choose an audience. When the user returns to ColonialLife.com, they will default to the audience homepage of their selection.

The header is made up of 4 components: logo, dropdown, primary nav, ancillary nav, search

**External Links**
