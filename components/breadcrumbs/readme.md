# **Breadcrumbs**

**Requirements**

* The purpose of the breadcrumb module is to show the user where they are currently oriented within the siteâ€™s architecture, not to show the path they have actually taken clicking through the site.
* The breadcrumb needs an active state to show the user where they are currently in the site. The active page does not need to be linked since the user is currently already on that page.
* Links in the breadcrumbs that are navigable need to look clickable.

**External Links**

Be sure to right-click the links below to open them in a new page.

*Add links to designs & wireframes here.*


# **Notes**

*Use this section to record any ideas or thoughs that you have about the component as it's being developed.*
