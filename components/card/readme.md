# **Notes**

* Cards are in portrait orientation by default
* Card images and icons are background images that will be positioned using css
* Cards are dependant on a 'deck' container and a 'deck-item' per card to work
*Use this section to record any ideas or thoughs that you have about the component as it's being developed.*
*Questions*
* Will Cards with 3+ cards in the container wrap and align to the left of the page?
* will 2 cards be centered in the available space or aligned left (this will impact the position of the wrapped cards)
